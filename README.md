# Natural Language Processing Simulation

This is a NLP project that is originated from a simulation we had at Hult International Business School
Course: Text Analytics

The simulation was based on questions related to the environment and climate change.
The following questions was asked to 45 individuals:

1)	What according to you is considered as being environmentally friendly?
2)	Tell us about a time you think you positively impacted climate change?
3)	What do you think you can do better to help avert climate change? 
4)	What do you think has the most amount of negative impact on the environment? 
5)	Have you heard about the term ‘ bleaching’? 
6)	Do you think World can resolve the issue of climate change in the coming decade?

Based on these questions, we wanted to predict the answer to question 6, which was supposed to be answered as YES or NO. This showed out to not work out, so my team had to manually go into the data and interpret the answer we got into YES/NO (1/0).
